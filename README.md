# Erin chrome extension

## Goal
The extension is designed to resemble Brave browser's newtab page, including the following improvements:
- Improved UI
- Extended wallpapers library
- Customizable wallpaper choice (in-progress)
- Absence of bloatware

## Stack
- React.js
- Styled-components
- TypeScript

## Motivation (not serious, please only read for gags)
So I actually fell in love with Brave's newtab page as soon as I opened the browser for the first time. It was downright love at first sight, everything about it (including wallpapers, top sites menu, etc.) was incredibly well-thought-out and nice-looking. I'd say it even looked sorta dribble-ish in a way. Although, just like any other love story this one couldn't last forever. Ever since I've found out about ungoogled-chromium I simply couldn't go back to the ~~normie~~ brave browser. My heart's always desired to be a "based floppa gigachad with a 2m long beard" so that's just the way my life has gone I guess. I couldn't help it but spend 3 hours of my time to compile bare-bones chromium and begin my journey of making its newtab page look just as fabulous as Brave's. On the other hand, anyone reading this could object:

> But Brave is completely open source so instead of being a smartass you could literally do ```git clone```.

I have a special way of writing code so I couldn't just copy-paste whatever wheel Brave's engineers have reinvented for the 5th time now. I obvisouly know how to do what they're paid for better so instead I ended up writing everything from scratch the way that only God and I understood. A couple of weeks in, it's only God who understands. Last but not least, this version of the extension has an extended backgorund library hosted by based [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) (unlike the virgin unsplashed library that consists of *literally* 5 images brave browser's version happens to use). It actually makes mine as customizable as possible without any additional spyware.
