# Erin chrome extension

## Motivation
So I kinda fell in love with Brave's newtab page as soon as I opened the browser for the first time. That was straight up love at first sight, everything about it including wallpapers, top sites menu, etc. was incredibly nice looking and it was even sorta dribble-ish in a way if you ask me. Although, like any love story this one couldn't last forever either. Ever since I found out about ungoogled-chromium I simply couldn't go back to the ~~normie-oriented~~ brave browser. My heart's always desired me to be a based floppa gigachad with a 2m long beard so I guess that's just the way my life has gone. I couldn't help it but ~~waste~~ spend 3 hours of my precious time to compile chromium and begin my journey of grinding to make it's newtab page look just as fucking good as Brave's. On the other hand, anyone reading this could object:

> But Brave is completely open source so instead of pretending to be smart you could just literally do a ```git clone``` or whatever

Which will only imply your absolute lack of culture and education and make me wanna:
- spit in your face
- explain everything to help your barely relevant understanding of this world
So first of all, I have a special style of writing code so I couldn't just copy/paste whatever wheel Brave's engineers have reinvented for the like, 5th time already. I obvisouly know how to do their job better so instead I just decided to create everything from scratch the way that only me and God understand what this entire codebase means. Tomorrow it will be just God, but that's not the point. Last but not the least, this version of the extension has a huge library of wallpapers that are hosted by based [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) (unlike the virgin/incel unsplashed library that consists of 5 images brave uses) which genuinely makes it as customizable as it gets without any additional spy- and bloatware.
