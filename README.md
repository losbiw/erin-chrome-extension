# Erin chrome extension

## Goal
The extension resembles Brave browser's newtab page's feel and look in almost every way, for the exception of:
- Slightly improved UI of certain elements
- Extended wallpapers library
- Customizable wallpapers choice
- Lack of bloatware (disappointed brave browser user's face)

## Technologies
- React.js
- Styled-components
- TypeScript

## Motivation (not serious, please only read for gags)
So I actually fell in love with Brave's newtab page as soon as I opened the browser for the first time. It was downright love at first sight, everything about it (including wallpapers, top sites menu, etc.) was incredibly well-thought-out and nice-looking. I'd say it even looked sorta dribble-ish in a way. Although, just like any other love story this one couldn't last forever. Ever since I've found out about ungoogled-chromium I simply couldn't go back to the ~~normie~~ brave browser. My heart's always desired to be a "based floppa gigachad with a 2m long beard" so that's just the way my life has gone I guess. I couldn't help it but spend 3 hours of my time to compile bare-bones chromium and begin my journey of making its newtab page look just as fabulous as Brave's. On the other hand, anyone reading this could object:

> But Brave is completely open source so instead of pretending to be smart you could just literally do a ```git clone```.

Which will only imply that I definitely need to go touch some grass, yet things aren't looking much better for you either. Hearing things like this makes me wanna do either of the following two:
- Spit in your face
- Give you the bare minimum of understanding how this life works, prick

To start things off, I have a special style of writing code so I couldn't just copy-paste whatever wheel Brave's engineers have reinvented for the like, 5th time now. I obvisouly know how to do what they're paid for better so instead I ended up writing everything from scratch the way that only God and I understood. A couple of weeks in, it's just God who understands. Last but not the least, this version of the extension has an enormous (extended, if you will) library of wallpapers that are hosted by based [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) (unlike the virgin unsplashed library that consists of *literally* 5 images brave browser's version happens to use). It actually makes mine as customizable as it gets without any additional spyware.
